When having to rely on a prosthesis, using digital devices is difficult: Mouse, keyboard and touchscreens are designed for organic hands only. Yet amputees are often capable of using muscular gestures with their phantom hand, which can be read out. The team has created an interface between these signals and the digital world that opens up new possibilities. Shortcut translates phantom hand gestures and planar movements into a wireless computer control. It facilitates a quick re-entry into the profession and unrestricted digital interaction.</p><p>Shortcut was developed in cooperation with Ottobock Healthcare AG and Fab Lab Berlin.",

Her research stems from the areas of biological-based art, digital art and DIY practices and addresses topics of self-organisation, randomness, morphology and pattern generation. Her works combine audiovisual and hybrid media to immersive installations or site-specific interventions whereas she treats nature's phenomena not only as inspiration but as a material and critical process.</p><p>Her works have been shown at Ars Electronica Linz, ArtLaboratory Berlin, Arge Kultur Salzburg, KIBLA Maribor, KW Kunstwerke Berlin, Newcastle Region Art Gallery, Electrofringe Festival, Istanbul Biennale, European Media Art Festival, etc. She is co-editor of the book \"Experiencing the Unconventional. Science in Art\" and curator of the interdisciplinary conference \"Inoculum – Connecting the Other\".",

Working with biotechnology, biophysical sensing, and more recently artificial intelligence and neurorobotics, Donnarumma expresses the chimerical nature of the body with a new and unsettling intensity. He is renown for his skill in using sound, whose physicality and depth he exploits to create experiences of instability, awe, shock and entrainment.</p><p>Actively contributing to the collaboration between art & science since a decade, Donnarumma’s arresting visions of the body have toured more than 60 countries worldwide, including, among the others, leading institutions and art events such as Venice Biennale, Steirischer Herbst, ZKM Center for Art and Media, Sónar+D Advanced Music Festival, ISEA, FILE Electronic Language International Festival, RPM: Ten Years of Sound Art in China, transmediale, CTM.",
